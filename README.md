## Project 1: Rock Paper Scissors
I referenced the code of MarkovChainClean.py from https://github.com/goelp14/RockPaperScissors.git and modified it, but it still can't fullfill the 60% winning rate for all the tests, I will continue to solving it. The result is below, it is not obviously better than directly asign value to the corresponding conditions.

Final results: {'p1': 461, 'p2': 110, 'tie': 429}

Player 1 win rate: 80.73555166374781%

Final results: {'p1': 448, 'p2': 378, 'tie': 174}

Player 1 win rate: 54.23728813559322%

Final results: {'p1': 332, 'p2': 360, 'tie': 308}

Player 1 win rate: 47.97687861271676%

Final results: {'p1': 445, 'p2': 332, 'tie': 223}

Player 1 win rate: 57.27155727155727%
