## Project 1: Rock Paper Scissors
I referenced the code of MarkovChainClean.py from https://github.com/goelp14/RockPaperScissors.git and modified it, but it still can't fullfill the 60% winning rate for all the tests, I will continue to solving it. The result is below, it is not obviously better than directly asign value to the corresponding conditions.

loop for all the possibilities of the assignment of the value combination to the R,P,S

Althoug the win rate are so low, I'm happy about it because there must be something was found, it is impossible to avoid all of the correct answers even for random selection.
